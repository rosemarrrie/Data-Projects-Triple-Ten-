# Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involved analyzing Airbnb data for the Manhattan vacation rental market to provide data-driven guidance to a client on optimal property types for investment. The analysis aimed to identify which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive for vacation rentals and to estimate the revenue generated by these top-performing listings.

## Business Challenge

A local Airbnb investor sought help analyzing the Manhattan vacation rental market to receive guidance on property types for investment. The core challenges addressed were:
* Identifying the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes (number of bedrooms) for vacation rentals.
* Calculating the potential earnings from these high-performing listings.

## Data Source

The analysis utilized Airbnb data for New York City, focusing specifically on Manhattan listings. Key columns and data sources included:
* `number_of_reviews_ltm`: Reviews in the last 12 months, used as a criterion for listing attractiveness.
* `neighborhood`: To identify attractive areas.
* `bedrooms`: To determine popular property sizes.
* `adjusted_price` and `available` from the `calendar` sheet: Used for revenue calculation.

## Project Phases & Methodology

The project was executed in distinct phases, focusing on data preparation, analytical insights, and comprehensive documentation.

### Part 1: Determining Attractive Neighborhoods and Property Sizes

This phase aimed to identify the most appealing areas and property configurations for vacation rental investments.

* **1.1 Identifying Most Attractive Neighborhoods:**
    * **Data Cleaning:** The `neighborhood` column labels were cleaned for inconsistent capitalization and trailing spaces, with cleaned values stored in a `neighborhood_clean` column.
    * **Analysis:** A pivot table was built using `number_of_reviews_ltm` to identify the top 10 most attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals.
    * **Visualizations:** A bar chart and pie chart were created to visualize the number of reviews for these top 10 listings.
    * **Outcome:** The top 10 neighborhoods identified were Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown, Upper West Side, Chelsea, East Village, East Harlem, West Village, and Upper East Side. Lower East Side had 6242 reviews, Hell's Kitchen had 5506, and Harlem had 5157.

* **1.2 Determining Most Popular Property Sizes:**
    * **Data Cleaning:** The `bedrooms` column was cleaned to handle empty cells (representing zero-bedroom/studio apartments), with clean values stored in a `bedrooms_clean` column.
    * **Analysis:** A pivot table determined that Studios (0 bedrooms), 1-bedroom, and 2-bedroom rentals were the most popular property types across the dataset.
        * 0 Bedrooms: 441 listings
        * 1 Bedroom: 1265 listings
        * 2 Bedrooms: 526 listings
    * **Outcome:** These sizes were identified as generally popular for rentals.

* **1.3 Neighborhood-Specific Property Size Preferences:**
    * **Analysis:** The pivot table was updated to recommend specific property sizes for each of the top 10 neighborhoods, revealing that demand changes depending on the neighborhood.
    * **Outcome:** For example, 1-bedroom units were the most popular property size across all top neighborhoods with the exception of Midtown, where studios were most popular.

### Part 2: Calculating Revenue Generation of Attractive Listings

This phase focused on estimating the financial performance of the most attractive and popular listings.

* **2.1 Identifying Top Listings:**
    * **Criteria:** Listings matching the top 10 neighborhoods and their respective most popular property sizes (e.g., 1-bedroom for most neighborhoods, studios for Midtown) were flagged as "top listings".

* **2.2 Estimated Revenue Calculation:**
    * **Data Preparation:** A `revenue_earned` column was added to the `calendar` data, setting it to `adjusted_price` if `available` was "f" (rented) and $0 otherwise.
    * **Aggregation:** The total `revenue_earned` from a 30-day period in the `calendar` data was brought over to the `listings` data using the `SUMIF()` function.

* **2.3 Ranking Top Listings by Revenue:**
    * **Analysis:** A pivot table was created to order all top listings according to their estimated revenue, using the `top_listing` flag as a filter.
    * **Outcome:** Listing ID `49946551` was identified as the top-producing listing, generating `$29,940.00` over the 30-day period. This indicates a strong earning potential for future investments, especially for 1-bedroom units in East Harlem.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

This analysis identified optimal investment opportunities within the Manhattan vacation rental market:
* **Targeted Neighborhoods:** Focus on the top 10 neighborhoods, particularly Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, and Harlem, which show the highest attractiveness based on reviews.
* **Property Size Optimization:** Invest in 1-bedroom units as they are generally the most popular, with a specific focus on studio apartments for areas like Midtown where demand differs. The analysis displays that 1 bedroom units located in East Harlem may have the highest earning potential for future investments.
* **Revenue Potential:** The top-earning listing (ID `49946551`) demonstrated substantial revenue, reinforcing the value of strategic investments in attractive locations and property types.

## Spreadsheet Organization & Documentation

The project spreadsheet was meticulously organized and documented for clarity and professionalism:
* **Executive Summary and Table of Contents:** Included at the beginning for easy navigation and understanding.
* **Data Cleaning Log:** Detailed documentation of all data cleaning steps, including the creation of clean data sheets.
* **Assumptions:** Clearly documented assumptions made during the analysis.
* **Formatting:** Consistent formatting, borders, cell background colors, and font styles/sizes were applied throughout the spreadsheet.
* **Sheet Order:** Sheets were logically ordered, starting with summary and documentation sheets, followed by analytical results, calculation sheets, and raw data.
