# Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involved analyzing Airbnb data for the Manhattan vacation rental market to provide guidance to a client on optimal property types for investment. The analysis focused on identifying attractive neighborhoods and property sizes (number of bedrooms), and estimating the potential revenue generated by these listings.

## Business Challenge

The client sought data-driven recommendations on which property types to invest in within the Manhattan vacation rental market. This required answering two key questions:

1.  Which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive for vacation rentals?
2.  How much money did these attractive listings generate?

## Data Source

The analysis utilized Airbnb data for NYC. Key data points included:

* **Reviews in the last 12 months (`number_of_reviews_ltm`):** Used as a proxy for how often a property is rented, indicating its attractiveness.
* **Property details:** Including `neighborhood` and `bedrooms`.
* **Calendar data:** Containing `adjusted_price` and `availability` (`"f"` for rented, `"t"` for available).

## Project Phases & Methodology

The project was structured into two main parts, each addressing a core business question, followed by documentation and formatting.

### Goal 1: Determining Attractive Neighborhoods and Property Sizes

This phase focused on identifying the most appealing areas and property configurations for vacation rentals.

* **1.1 Identifying Most Attractive Neighborhoods:**
    * **Data Cleaning:** The `neighborhood` column labels were cleaned to remove inconsistent capitalization and trailing spaces, storing clean values in a new column called `neighborhood_clean`.
    * **Analysis:** A pivot table was built using `number_of_reviews_ltm` as the criterion to identify the top 10 most attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals. A bar chart displaying the number of reviews for these top 10 listings was also created.
    * **Outcome:** Identified the top 10 neighborhoods that would be the focus for the remainder of the analysis.

* **1.2 Determining Most Popular Property Sizes:**
    * **Data Cleaning:** Empty cells in the `bedrooms` column were cleaned (representing studio apartments or zero bedrooms) and stored in a new column called `bedrooms_clean` using an `IF` function.
    * **Analysis:** Another pivot table was built to determine the number of bedrooms most popular for rentals.
    * **Outcome:** Identified the 3 most popular property sizes (e.g., Studios, 1-bedrooms, 2-bedrooms).

* **1.3 Neighborhood-Specific Property Size Preferences:**
    * **Analysis:** The pivot table was updated to recommend specific property sizes for each of the top 10 neighborhoods, highlighting if different neighborhoods have different preferences.
    * **Outcome:** Identified optimal apartment sizes per neighborhood (e.g., 1-bedroom listings for most top neighborhoods, but studios for Midtown).

### Goal 2: Calculating Revenue Generation

This phase focused on estimating the financial performance of the most attractive and popular listings.

* **2.1 Identifying Top Listings:**
    * A new column, `top_listing`, was added to the `listings` data. A value of `1` was assigned if a listing matched the criteria of being in a top-10 neighborhood and having the most popular property size for that neighborhood (e.g., 1-bedroom for most, studio for Midtown), else `0`.

* **2.2 Estimating Revenue Earned:**
    * **Calendar Data Preparation:** A `revenue_earned` column was added to the `calendar` data. If `available` was "f" (rented), `revenue_earned` was set to `adjusted_price`; otherwise, it was $0.
    * **Listings Data Aggregation:** A `revenue_earned` column was added to the `listings` data. The `SUMIF()` function was used to bring over the total `revenue_earned` from the 30-day `calendar` data for each listing.

* **2.3 Ranking Top Listings by Revenue:**
    * **Analysis:** A pivot table was created to order all top listings (filtered by `top_listing = 1`) according to their estimated revenue.
    * **Outcome:** Identified the top-earning listing and highlighted potential annual revenue by multiplying the 30-day estimated revenue by 12.

### Goal 3: Organization and Documentation

To ensure a polished and professional project submission, the spreadsheet was meticulously organized and documented.

* **Executive Summary and Table of Contents:** The analysis included a comprehensive executive summary and a table of contents.
* **Data Cleaning Log:** All data cleaning steps were documented in a separate sheet, and a copy of the raw data was maintained.
* **Assumptions Documentation:** Key assumptions made during the analysis were clearly documented.
* **Consistent Formatting:** Formatting, borders, cell background colors, and font styles/sizes were applied consistently across the entire analysis for readability.
* **Hidden Columns:** Unnecessary columns were hidden to streamline the view.

## Project Deliverable

The final project was submitted as a Google Sheets file, with view-only access, demonstrating the comprehensive analysis of the Manhattan vacation rental market, including conversion attractiveness, property size preferences, and revenue generation estimates.
